# Sup, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I store all my personal projects, study materials and fun code snippets here on my GitHub. I do aim to deliver and make public repos of software I build in the future. So be sure to watch this space.

## :walking: A bit about me...
I have two pets a :snake: and a :cat:

I'm also a junior .net developer supporting the education sector in the UK. Right now I live in Manchester. You can usually find me storing myself away playing video games, studying hard and practicing my coding skills.

## :books: What am I currently learning? 
- C# and more specifically ASP.NetCore  
- SQL, I must master the art of databases  
- JavaScript - Ofcourse 
- HTML/CSS - Accessible, yet pretty websites for all!
- The Bass Guitar :guitar:
