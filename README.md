# Sup, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I store all my personal projects, study materials and fun code snippets here on my GitHub. I do aim to deliver and make public repos of software I build in the future. So be sure to watch this space. :wink:

## :walking: What do I do?  
I'm a junior developer supporting the education sector in the UK. Right now I live in Manchester, UK. You can usually find me storing myself away playing video games, studying hard and practicing my coding skills.

## :books: What am I currently learning? 
- C# and more specifically ASP.NetCore  
- SQL, I must master the art of databases  
- JavaScript - Ofcourse 
- HTML/CSS - I want to contribute to making the web accesible!
